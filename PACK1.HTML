        <h1>PACKAGES</h1>
        <P> A package is a database object that groups logically related the procedures, functions, variables, cursors, and type declarations into a single unit.
           There is a considerable performance improvement because of this encapsulation. The entire package is loaded into the memory when a procedure or a function, within the package, is called to the first time. This reduces the unnecessary disk I/O and network traffic.
           <BR></BR>
     PL/SQL package is like a library once written stored in the Oracle database and can be used by many applications. A package usually has two parts:</P>
     <h2>PACKAGE SPECIFICATION</h2>
     <P>The package specification is required when you create a new package The package specification lists all the objects which are publicly accessible from other applications declares the types, variables, constants, exceptions, cursors, and subprograms (procedure ir function). The scope of these declarations is local to your database schema and global to the package. So, the declared objects are accessible from your application and from anywhere a the package.
    </P>
    <H2>PACKAGE BODY</H2>
    <P>A package body contains the code that implements the package specification. It fully
    
        defines cursors, procedures and functions declared in the package specification. Unlike a
        
        package specification, the declarative part of a package body can contain subprogram.</P>
