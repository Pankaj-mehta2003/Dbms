        <h1>HAVING CLAUSE</h1>
        <p><SPAN>HAVING</SPAN> clause is used to filter data based on the group functions. It is used to specify which groups are to be displayed, that is, restrict the groups that you return on the basis of group functions. Simply, conditional retrieval of rows from a grouped result is possible with the HAVING clause.
            <br>
            This is similar to WHERE condition but is used with group functions. Group functions cannot be used in WHERE clause but can be used in having clause.
    <p><span>SYNTAX</span>:
        
        <pre>
    SELECT column_list, group function(column)
    FROM table_name
    [WHERE CONDITION]
    [GROUP BY group_by_expression]
    [HAVING having_expression]
    [ORDER BY column];
        </pre> 
            </p>
