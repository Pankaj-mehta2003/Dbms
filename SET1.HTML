        <p><span>SET Operators </span>are used to combine information of similar type from one or more than one table. At first sight this looks similar to SQL joins although there is big difference. SQL joins tends to combine columns from different tables, whereas SQL SET Operators combine rows from different queries. In brief, SET Operators combine results from two or more queries (SELECT statements) into one result.
    
            <h2>All involved SELECT Statements must:</h2>
          
           1. Retrieve the same number of columns
            <br>
           2.  The data types of corresponding columns in each involved SELECT must be compatible (esther the same or with possibility implicatly convert to the data types of the first SELECT statement)</p>
