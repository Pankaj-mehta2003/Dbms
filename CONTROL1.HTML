        <p>As the name implies, PL/SQL supports programming language features. <span>PL/SQL</span> control structures enable you to direct the flow of execution within your programs, providing mechanisms for making decisions, repeating actions, and handling exceptions. You can change the logical flow of statements within the PL/SQL block with a number of control structures.
        <br>
    Three types of PL/SQL control structures are:
    1.Conditional Control
    <br>
    2.CASE expressions
    <br>
    3.LOOP/ITERATIVE control
