    <div class="main"> <p>A <span>procedure or stored procedure </span>is a named PL/SQL block that can accept parameters (sometimes referred to as arguments), and be invoked Generally speaking a procedure is mainly used to perform one or more specific task. A procedure has a header a declaration section, an executable section and an optional exception-handling section . 
        <br>
        A procedure can be compiled and stored in the database as a schema object. Procedures promote reusability and maintainability When validated, they can be used in any number. of applications. If the requirements change, only the procedure needs to be updated.

    <h2>How to pass parameters in procedure:</h2>
    When you want to create a procedure or function, you have to define parameters .There is three ways to pass parameters in procedure: <br>
    
    1.IN parameters: Parameters defined with the IN mode are used to pass values into the procedure. These parameters are read-only within the procedure, meaning their values cannot be modified inside the procedure. They are typically used to provide input values to the procedure.<br>
    2.OUT parameters: arameters defined with the OUT mode are used to return values from the procedure. These parameters are write-only within the procedure, meaning they must be assigned a value inside the procedure before the procedure completes. The calling code can then access the assigned value after the procedure is executed.<br>
    3.INOUT parameters: Parameters defined with the IN OUT mode are used for both passing values into the procedure and returning values from the procedure. These parameters can be read from and written to within the procedure, allowing both input and output operations.</p></div>
