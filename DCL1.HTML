    <div class="main"><p><span>DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE(DCL)</span> is a language used to control access to the the data stored in a database. Thus DCL is mainly related to the security issues, i.e determining who has access to the database objects and what operations they can perform on them. The task of the DCL is to prevent unauthorized access to data. Each user in a relational database system has a specific authorization. The access to database tables and other database objects must be rescricted to authorized users only. The database administrator(DBA) is a high-level user with the ability to create new users and grant different rights to them to access the database and its objects.</p>
        <p><span>DATABASE PRIVILIGES</span> <br>
      Priviliges are the rights or permissions used to execute particular SQL statements. Priviliges determine whether or not a user can execute a given command. There are different types of priviliges corresponding to different types of operations. Priviliges are granted by using the GRANT command and revoked by using the REVOKE command.</p></div>
