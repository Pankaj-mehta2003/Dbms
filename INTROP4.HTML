        <P><SPAN>%TYPE </SPAN>is used to declare variables whose data type is the same as a specific column in a table or cursor variable. It is particularly useful when you want to ensure that the data type of a variable matches the data type of a column, reducing the risk of data type mismatch errors.</P>

        <h1>%ROWTYPE</h1>
        <P><SPAN>%ROWTYPE </SPAN>is used to declare record variables whose structure matches the structure of a row in a table or a result set of a query. It is particularly useful when you want to work with entire rows of data without specifying individual column names.</P>

           <pre class="ex">
    ROW EMP%ROWTYPE;   </pre>
    Here, thw variable ROW will be a composte variable, consisting of the column names of the table as its members. To refer to a specific variable(say SAL), the following syntax will be used: <br>
    ROW.SAL:=50000;
