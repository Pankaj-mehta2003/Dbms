        <h1>LOOP/ITERATIVE CONTROL</h1>
       <P>The <span>PL/SQL </span>loops are used to repeat the execution of one or more statements for specified number of times. These are also known as iterative control statements.
    <br>There are 3 types of PL/SQL Loops:</P>
        
    <H2>1.BASIC LOOP</H2>
    <p>PL/SQL exit loop is used when a set of statements is to be executed at least once before the termination of the loop. There must be an EXIT condition specified in the loop, otherwise the loop will get into an infinite number of iterations. After the occurrence of EXIT condition, the process exits the loop.</p>
    <p><span>SYNTAX</span>:

    Loopstatements;
    . . . 
    EXIT [WHWN CONDITION];
    END LOOP;

        <br><H2>2.WHILE LOOP</H2>
        <P>PL/SQL while loop is used when a set of statements has to be executed as long as a condition is true, the While loop is used. The condition is decided at the beginning of each iteration and continues until the condition becomes false.</P>

            <P>PL/SQL for loop is used when when you want to execute a set of statements for a predetermined number of times. The loop is iterated between the start and end integer values. The counter is always incremented by 1 and once the counter reaches the value of end integer, the loop ends.</P>
