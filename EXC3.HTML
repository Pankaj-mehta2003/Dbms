        <h1>USERDEFINED EXCEPTIONS</h1>
      <P>In addition to the predefined exceptions, you can also define your own exceptions.
        Unlike predefined exceptions, user-defined exceptions are declared and defined by the user.
        User-defined exceptions are declared in the declaration section of PL./SQL block with their type as EXCEPTION. They must be raised explicitly using the RAISE statement, unlike predefined exceptions that are raised implicitly.
    <BR></BR>
    <H2>Steps to be followed to use User-defined Exceptions:</H2>
    (i) They should be explicitly declared in the Declaration section.
    (Declaring an Exception)
    <BR></BR>
    (i) They should be explicitly raised in the Execution section.
    (Raising an Exception)
    <BR></BR>
    (iii) They should be handled by referencing the user-defined exception name in the
    Exception section.</P>
