    <div class="main"><p>In Oracle, <span>PL/SQL</span>(Procedural Language SQL) is the procedural language extension to the non-procedural SQL. It combines the data manipulation power of SQL and procedural power of standard programming languages. It was developed by ORACLE CORPORATION in the early 90's to enhance the capabilities of SQL. SO, it integrates well with SQL *Plus and other application development products of Oracle.
        <br>
        PL/SQL incorporates many of the advanced features of programming languages that were designed during the 1970s and 1980s. It allows the data manipulation and query statements of SQL to be included in block-structured and procedural units of code, making PL/SQL a powerful transaction processing language.
        <br>
        PL/SQL is the superset of SQL. So, it fully supports SQL data manipulation commands and SQL datatypes. PL/SQL also has boolean and composite datatypes to handle comlex data. It supports standard programming features such as control statements, procedures and functions.</p>
