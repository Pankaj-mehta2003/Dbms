        <p>In SQL, Transaction Control Language (TCL) consists of commands used to manage transactions within a database. TCL commands allow users to control the transactions' effects on the database, including committing changes or rolling them back to their original state. The main TCL commands are COMMIT AND ROLLBACK.
      
          Here's a brief overview of each TCL command:</p>
         <p><span> 1.COMMIT:</span></p>
      
          The COMMIT command is used to make permanent changes to the database that were made during the current transaction. Once a COMMIT command is executed, all changes made by the transaction become permanent and visible to other users.
          <p><span>2.ROLLBACK</span></p>
          The ROLLBACK command is used to undo changes made during the current transaction and revert the database to its state before the transaction began. It cancels any uncommitted transactions and discards any changes made by them.
          <p><span>3.SAVEPOINT:</span></p>
      
      The SAVEPOINT command is used to define a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. It allows you to divide a transaction into smaller segments and rollback to a specific point if necessary.
