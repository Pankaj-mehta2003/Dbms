    <div class="main"> <p> The <span>DML</span> in dbms is one of the types of SQL queries. It stands for Data Manipulation Language. The DML commands in Structured Query Language (SQL) are responsible for making any change in the data present in SQL databases. The change can be anything, it can be inserting new records in the table, or altering the data present in the table or removing some existing data from the database table.
        <BR></BR>
        Let's say we have a table maintaining the records of our students. If any new student joins the school, then we need to add the data of that student into our table, this is called insertion of data and this can be achieved by using the <span>INSERT </span> command of SQL. Now, if we have to update some details of any student in the future, then we are free to update the existing record information using the <span>UPDATE </span> command of DML. Also, in case any student leaves the school or any other situation arises in which we no longer want to store the details of that student, then we can simply delete the record of that student using the <span>DELETE </span>command of the Data Manipulation Language in SQL. We can also think of the case when we want to see the data of the students then we can retrieve the data by using the SELECT keyword in SQL.
