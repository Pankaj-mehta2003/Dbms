    <div class="main"><h1>EXCEPTION HANDLING</h1> <p>
        In PL/SQL, a warning or error condition is called an exception, which arises during program execution. Run-time errors or exceptions arise from design faults, coding mistakes. hardware failures, and many other sources. When an error occurs, an exception is raised, ve the normal execution stops and the control transfers to the exception handling part of the PL/SQL block
    <br>
        Exceptions are identifiers in PL/SQL which may be raised during the execution of a block to terminate its main body of actions. A block will always terminate when an exception is raised, but you may specify an Exception Handler to perform final actions before the block terminates.
        <H2>ADVANTAGES OF EXCEPTION HANDLING </h2>  
    <BR></BR>
            1.Without exception handling, every time a command is issued, a check must be made
            
            for execution errors. With exception handling, errors are handled conveniently.
            
            without the need to code multiple checks
            <BR></BR>
            2.Exception handling improves readability by isolating error handling routines.
            <BR></BR>
            3.Exception handling improves reliability. One need not worry about checking for an error at every point it might occur. If a PL/SQL block contains an exception handler,and if an exception is ever raised in that block, the exception handler will handle the exception.

            Exception can either be of two types:
            <br>
            1.Predefined exceptions
            <br>
            2.User-defined exceptions
