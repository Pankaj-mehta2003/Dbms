        <h1>AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS/GROUP FUNCTIONS</h1>
        <p>Aggregate functions, also called Group functions are built-in SQL functions that operate on groups of rows and return one value for the entire group or table. Aggregate functions are used to produce summarized results. They operate on sets of rows and return results based on groups of rows. By default all rows in a table are treated as one group.
        <br>
    Types of Aggregate Functions:
    <br>
    1.COUNT()
    <br>
    2.SUM()
    <br>
    3.MAX
    <br>
    4.MIN()
    <br>
    5.AVG()
