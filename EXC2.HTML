        <h1>PREDEFINED EXCEPTIONS</h1>
      <P>Predefined exceptions are internally defined by runtime system. Predefined exceptions are raised implicitly whenever PL/SQL program violates an ORACLE rule or exceeds a system-dependent limit. Every Oracle error has a number, but exceptions must be handled by name. So, PL/SQL predefines some common ORACLE errors as exceptions.
        For example, if you try to divide a number by zero then PL/SQL raises an exception called ZERO_DIVIDE and if SELECT can not find a record then PL/SQL raises exception NO_DATA_FOUND.</P>
       Some of the pre-defined exceptions are:
       <br>
    1.NO_DATA_FOUND:
    
    Raised when a SELECT INTO statement returns no rows.
    2.TOO_MANY_ROWS:
    
    Raised when a SELECT INTO statement returns multiple rows.
    <br>    3.DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX:
    
    Raised when a unique constraint or index violation occurs. <br>
    4.ZERO_DIVIDE:
    
    Raised when division by zero occurs. <br>
    5.INVALID_CURSOR:
    
    Raised when a cursor operation is performed on an invalid cursor. <br>
    6.CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN:
    
    Raised when an attempt is made to open a cursor that is already open. <br>
    7.VALUE_ERROR:
    
    Raised when a conversion error or arithmetic error occurs.
