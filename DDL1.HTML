        <p> <span>DDL (Data Definition Language)</span> commands in SQL are used to define, modify, and remove the structure of database objects. They primarily deal with creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables, indexes, views, and schemas. DDL commands enable users to manage the structure of the database, including its organization, constraints, and permissions. Here are some common DDL commands:
            <br>
    
            <span>CREATE</span>: Used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            
           <span>ALTER</span> : Used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding or deleting columns from a table, modifying data types, or renaming objects.
           <br>
           <br>
            
            <span>DROP</span>: Used to delete existing database objects like tables, views, indexes, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <span>TRUNCATE</span>: Used to remove all records from a table while preserving its structure.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <span>RENAME</span>: Used to rename an existing database object.
            <br>
            <br>
            
           <span>COMMENT</span> : Used to add comments or descriptions to database objects.
           <br>
           <br>
            
            These commands are fundamental for managing the schema of a database, enabling users to define and manipulate its structure according to their requirements.</p>
