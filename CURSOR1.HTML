        <h1>CURSOR</h1>
        <P><span>Cursor</span> is a private SQL work area that Oracle uses to execute SQL statements and store ormation Whenever you issue a SQL statement, the Oracle server opens an area of memory in which the command is parsed and executed. This area is called a cursor This temporary work area is used to store the data retrieved from the database, and manipulate this data. A cursor can hold more than one row, but can process only one row at a time. The set of rows the cursor holds is called the Active Set</P>
        There are two types of cursors:
        <br>
        1.Implicit cursor
        <br>
        2.Explicit cursor
