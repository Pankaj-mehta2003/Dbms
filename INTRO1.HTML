        <P><span>SQL </span>stands for "Structured Query Language" and can be pronounced as SQL or SEQUEL It is a special-purpose language used to define, access, and manipulate data in RDBMS. SQL provides a set of statements for storing and retrieving data to and from a relational database. The original version called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) was designed by IBM in mid-1970s SQL was first introduced as a commercial database system in 1979 by Oracle Corporation.

            Today, almost all modern Relational Database Management Systems like Microsoft SQL Server Microsoft Access, Oracle DB2 Sybase, MySQL and Informix use SQL as standard database language Most of these have provided their own implementation this enhancing its feature and making it a powerful tool For example. Microsoft SQL Sen Ms version of the SQL is called T-SQL, Oracle version of SQL is called PL/SQL, and MS Ac version of SQL is called JET SQL etc.

                SQL is different from other programming languages like C++ Visual Basic ettell non-procedural, English-like language that processes data in groups of records rather than one record at a time. Unlike programs in other languages, where you specify the sequence of steps to be performed a SQL program/SQL statement only expresses the desired resul The responsibility for determining how the data will be processed in order to generate the desired result is left to the database management system. This non-procedural nature of SQL makes it easier to access data in application programs.
